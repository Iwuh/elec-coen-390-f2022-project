    <string name="Rules_and_Regulation">Rules and Regulations:
\n\nUse of the Library

\nAccess to the Library is permitted only for the purpose of using library resources or for the purpose of
academic study. Loitering is not permitted. Soliciting is not permitted. Audio recording, videotaping,
photography, and other audio-visual recording are not permitted except where expressly authorized by
the Library in accordance with the University Policy on Filming and Photography on University Premises.

\nMore information about filming is available at: http://library.concordia.ca/about/policies/filming.php

\n\nCode of Conduct

\nUsers are expected to behave in a civil and quiet manner at all times. Additionally, users should note the
particular requirements listed below:

\n\n\t\t\tShow Respect to Others
\nUsers must behave in a civil manner towards Library staff members and other users. Behaviour that
threatens, harasses or demeans others is not tolerated in the Library. Such behaviour undermines the
peace and security of the Library, and contravenes the University’s Code of Rights and Responsibilities.
\nUsers are asked not to occupy excessive space, and not to leave personal effects unattended in study
areas, so that all can find a place to work in the Library. Users are asked only to occupy specialized workstations (e.g. microform reading stations, computer workstations, adaptive workstations for users
with disabilities) when using the specialized features.

\n\n\t\t\tContribute to a Quiet Atmosphere
\nDisruptive noise is not permitted. This includes any noise or activity that disturbs the concentration of
other users such as loud talking, noise from electronic devices and long conversations on electronic
devices. In addition, electronic devices should be turned on silent mode throughout the Library.
\nIn collaborative spaces, including group study rooms, quiet talking using a low voice is permitted.
\nIn silent study rooms and other spaces designated for silent study, silence is required. Talking or noise
from electronic devices, including headphones, is not permitted.
\nThe Friends of the Library Room located in LB-361 is a zero-noise room that has been set aside to
provide a peaceful oasis for quiet reflection. In addition to no talking or noise from electronic devices,
including headphones, no keyboarding is permitted.

\n\n\t\t\tFood and Beverages
\nBeverages are permitted if they are in spill proof containers only. Food is prohibited except for designated snacking areas

\n\n\t\t\tRespect Library Resources, Spaces and Facilities
\nUsers are responsible for the careful handling of Library materials. Defacing or damaging Library
materials (such as through marking, highlighting, underlining, writing notes, attaching post-it notes,
folding corners, removing pages, or removing security devices) is forbidden.
\nUsers are responsible for using Library spaces, equipment, furnishings and facilities in a responsible and
respectful way. This helps to preserve facilities and ensure a welcoming and clean environment. Users
must not place their feet on chairs, window sills or tables and must keep spaces neat and tidy.

\n\n\t\t\tHonour Library Policies
\nUsers are responsible for informing themselves of Library policies. These policies are designed to ensure
the security of people and resources, including electronic resources, and to maximize equitable access
to materials and facilities. Excessive or repeated infractions are costly and disruptive to the University
community as a whole. Library policies are available at: http://library.concordia.ca/about/policies/
